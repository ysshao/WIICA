WIICA: Workload ISA-Independent Characterization for Applications

v1.0 Public Release
=================================================================
WIICA is a workload characterization tool to characterize the ISA-independent
characteristics of applications in the context of specialized architectures.

If you use WIICA in your research, please cite:

(ISPASS), April 2013

==================================================================
0. Build WIICA

1) LLVM 3.4 and Clang 3.4 64-bit
2) LLVM IR Trace Profiler (LLVM-Tracer)
   LLVM-Tracer is an LLVM compiler pass that instruments code in LLVM
   machine-independent IR. It prints out a dynamic trace of your program, which
   then be take as input for WIICA (and Aladdin.)

   You can download LLVM-Tracer from here:
   [https://github.com/ysshao/LLVM-Tracer]

   To build LLVM-Tracer:
   1. Set `LLVM_HOME` to where you installed LLVM
      ```
      export LLVM_HOME=/your/path/to/llvm
      export PATH=$LLVM_HOME/bin/:$PATH
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LLVM_HOME/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      ```
   2. Go to where you put LLVM-Tracer source code

      ```
      cd /path/to/LLVM-Tracer
      cd /path/to/LLVM-Tracer/full-trace
      make
      cd /path/to/LLVM-Tracer/profile-func
      make
      ```

=================================================================
1. Run WIICA:
After you build LLVM-Tracer, you need to specify the function names you want to
instrument in the programs to run in environment variable WORKLOAD. You can use
example SHOC programs in the SHOC director to run WIICA.

An example to run wiica is:
  cd scripts
  python run_wiica.py --directory /your/path/to/wiica/SHOC/fft/ --source fft --analysis_types memory

=================================================================

Related scripts:
1) run_wiica.py
	The interface of wiica.
	usage: run_wiica.py [-h] [--directory DIRECTORY]
                    [--source SOURCE]
                    [--analysis_types [{opcode,staticinst,memory,branch,basicblock,register} [{opcode,staticinst,memory,branch,basicblock,register} ...]]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --directory DIRECTORY
                        ABSOLUTE directory of the benchmark
  --source SOURCE       a list of source files with suffixes, e.g. fft.c, md.c, etc.
  --analysis_types [{opcode,staticinst,memory,branch,basicblock,register} [{opcode,staticinst,memory,branch,basicblock,register} ...]]
                        Type of analysis. Separate multiple values with
                        spaces. The supported analysis types are shown.

2) compile.py
  Compiling the program with LLVM-Tracer to generate a dynamic LLVM IR trace.

3) process_trace.py
    For those benchmarks with "llvm.memset" instrinsic. It replaces "llvm.memset" with several non-intrinsic instructions.

4) analysis.py
   Performing opcode,staticinst,memory,branch,basicblock,register analysis.
   Opcode: Opcode Breakdown into Compute, Memory, and Branch
   StaticInst: Number of dynamic executions for each static instruction, sorted
               by the dynamic counts
   Memory: Memory Footprint, Memory Global/Local Entropy[Shao2013]
   Branch: Branch Entropy[Shao2013]
   BasicBlock: Size and number of dynamic executions of each basic block

5) mem_analysis.py
   Spatial Locality Score, see [Weinberg2005] for more details.
   Temporal Locality Scor, see [Weinberg2005] for more details.

6) reg_analysis.py
   Register Degrees: The averarge use of registers, equals to the total number of register read divided by the total number of register write, see [Franklin1992] for more details.
   Register Distribution: The distribution of the register dependency distance.
   Register Lifetime: The distribution of the distance between the creation and the last use of registers, see [Franklin1992] for more details.
   Register Number: The number of register required at a certain point. We assume the application is executed 1 instruction per cycle.
